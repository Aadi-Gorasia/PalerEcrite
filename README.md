> **"THE ANTIDOTE TO SILENCE."**

A radical, brutalist digital publishing platform designed to disrupt the boredom of modern literature. This project features high-performance web animations, custom physics-based interactions, and a raw, noise-soaked aesthetic.

## ⚡ SYSTEM SPECS

### 1. Tactile Physics Cursor
Replaced the default system cursor with a **dual-layer reticle system**:
*   **The Dot:** A sharp red point (`#ff3300`) tied instantly to mouse coordinates for precision.
*   **The Ring:** A heavy, hollow circle that follows the dot with calculated linear interpolation (Lerp), creating a sense of weight and drag (inspired by *Studio Elio* but aggressive).

### 2. Chaotic Typography
*   **Font Stack:** 'Syne' (Artistic), 'Space Grotesk' (Technical), 'Cinzel' (Classic/Serif).
*   **Text Scrambling:** Custom JavaScript algorithm that decrypts/encrypts text on hover (`A -> X -> % -> HELLO`).
*   **Marquee:** Infinite scrolling text banners using Tailwind animations.

### 3. Performance Core
*   **Lenis Scroll:** Implemented for buttery smooth, momentum-based scrolling that overrides the default browser behavior.
*   **GSAP ScrollTrigger:** Elements reveal, float, and parallax based on scroll position.
*   **Page Transitions:** A "curtain" effect wipes the screen vertically between page navigations for a seamless Single-Page-Application (SPA) feel.
